# Changelog

  expected

## [v0.2.1] - 2025-08-28

- Fix build step in Dockerfile

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-08-28

- Rewrite action from Rust to Go, to minimize third-party dependencies
    - The original motivation for writing this GitHub action myself was to minimize third-party
      dependencies. But when writing Rust, one has to depend on third-party libraries, since the
      standard library is relatively lightweight. Go, on the other hand, has a batteries-included
      standard library, letting us build the action without any dependencies besides my own utility
      libraries for Go. Not having to keep as many third-party dependencies up to date lessens the
      maintenance burden of this action.
